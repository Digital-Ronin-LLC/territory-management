### Dashboard Component Fix
- Fixed syntax errors in Dashboard.tsx
- Properly structured the React component with imports at the top
- Wrapped JSX elements in a parent container to resolve "Adjacent JSX elements" error
- Added proper state management with useState and useEffect
- Created basic loading simulation for data
- Assumed PyramidChartWidget component structure based on usage

Key fixes:
1. Added proper import statements at the top of the file
2. Wrapped all JSX in a single parent `<div className="dashboard-container">`
3. Added state management for data and loading status
4. Structured pyramid chart widgets as children of the container
